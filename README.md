# Quickshell WIP

My WIP quickshell config.

## Configuring

> [!CAUTION]
> It is highly recommended to use the configuration menu for changing options, rather than editing the config.conf manually. If you should choose to manually edit it anyways, your choices will not be validated, and therefore could cause things to break.

Configuration file is located at `$HOME/.config/quickshell/config.conf`
