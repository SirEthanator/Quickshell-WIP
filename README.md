# Quickshell WIP

My WIP quickshell config.

## Configuring

> [!CAUTION]
> Configuration should be modified through the configuration menu rather than by directly editing config.conf. Manual edits to the configuration file bypass validation and may result in unexpected behavior.

Configuration file is located at `$HOME/.config/quickshell/config.conf`
